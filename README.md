# Next.js Project

## Description
This project is a Next.js application integrated with a Python backend, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for typing, and ESLint for maintaining code quality. It is designed to be modular, with components and library utilities that can be reused throughout the application.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Python (if interacting with the Python backend)

## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd [project-directory]
```

Then, install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```


## Running the Project

To run the Next.js application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Navigate to this URL in your browser to view the application.

If there is a backend portion written in Python, follow the instructions specific to that part of the project, which should be detailed in the `api` directory.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript and JavaScript into static files for deployment and start the application in production mode.
